    <h2> This AI combo could unlock human-level intelligence </h2>
    <p> A new approach that combines large language models with
        symbolic reasoning has the potential to achieve human-level intelligence,
        according to researchers. The method, called "Neuro-Symbolic AI," leverages
        the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create
        more powerful AI systems. By integrating these two approaches, researchers
        believe they can overcome some of the limitations of current AI technologies
        and move closer to achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI).

    <h2>Putting nature on the balance sheet: how to account for the ecological costs of our actions </h2>
    <p>An economist might celebrate a nation achieving record economic growth 
       on one day, yet overlook a coral reef lying bleached and lifeless on another. 
       This contradiction must be challenged, writes economist Partha Dasgupta 
       in his elegant account of why the global economic system is exploiting, 
       rather than sustaining, life on our planet. </p>
